A variety of affordable, engineering-oriented pursuits on a spectrum from expert-led to independent. The experts teach the aspiring makers the concepts, the skills and the resources which the makers will turn into real prototypes, allowing them to truly learn by doing. Expert advisors/mentors who are available to support our members. Monthly and daily membership plans for interested individuals, encouraging Do-It-Yourself culture and the maker mindset.
